**XM SendSecure** is a collaborative file exchange platform that is both highly secure and simple to use.
It is expressly designed to allow for the secure exchange of sensitive documents via virtual SafeBoxes.

XM SendSecure comes with a **Web API**, which is **RESTful**, uses **HTTPs** and returns **JSON**.

Specific libraries have been published for various languages:
**C#**,
[Java](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-java),
[JavaScript](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-js),
[PHP](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-php),
[Python](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-python)
and
[Ruby](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-ruby).

# sendsecure-csharp

**This library allows you to use the XM SendSecure Web API via C# with .NET.**

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- .NET version 4.5.2+
- The XM SendSecure solution, provided by [XMedius](https://www.xmedius.com?source=sendsecure-csharp) (demo accounts available on demand)

## Install Package

To use sendsecure-csharp in your C# project, clone or download the SendSecure C# .NET libraries directly from our GitHub repository.

# Quick Start

## Authentication (Retrieving API Token)

Authentication is done using an API Token, which must be first obtained based on SendSecure enterprise account and user credentials.
Here is the minimum code to get such a user-based API Token.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using XMedius.SendSecure;

namespace SendSecureClient
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            try
            {
                JsonObjects.UserToken tokenDetail = GetUserTokenAsync().GetAwaiter().GetResult();
            }
            catch (XMedius.SendSecure.Exceptions.SendSecureException e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
                if(!String.IsNullOrEmpty(e.Response))
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Server response: " + e.Response);
                }
            }
        }

        public static async Task<JsonObjects.UserToken> GetUserTokenAsync()
        {
            JsonObjects.UserToken tokenDetail = await XMedius.SendSecure.Client.GetUserTokenAsync("deathstar", "darthvader", "d@Rk$1De", "DV-TIE/x1", "TIE Advanced x1", "The Force App", new Uri("https://portal.xmedius.com"));

            Console.WriteLine(tokenDetail.Token);
            Console.WriteLine(tokenDetail.UserId);
            return tokenDetail;
        }
    }
}
```

## SafeBox Creation  (Using SafeBox Helper Class)

Here is the minimum required code to create a SafeBox â€“ with 1 recipient, a subject, a message and 1 attachment.
This example uses the user's *default* security profile (which requires to be set in the account).

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using XMedius.SendSecure;

namespace SendSecureClient
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            try
            {
                string token = "USER|1d495165-4953-4457-8b5b-4fcf801e621a";

                string userId = 123456;

                string previewUrl = SubmitSafeboxAsync(token).GetAwaiter().GetResult();
            }
            catch (XMedius.SendSecure.Exceptions.SendSecureException e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
                if(!String.IsNullOrEmpty(e.Response))
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Server response: " + e.Response);
                }
            }
        }

        public static async Task<string> SubmitSafeboxAsync(string token)
        {
            var safebox = new XMedius.SendSecure.Helpers.Safebox("darthvader@empire.com");
            safebox.Subject = "Family matters";
            safebox.Message = "Son, you will find attached the evidence.";

            safebox.Attachments.Add(new XMedius.SendSecure.Helpers.Attachment("d:\\Birth_Certificate.pdf", "application/pdf"));

            var recipient = new XMedius.SendSecure.Helpers.Participant("user@example.com");
            var contactMethod = new XMedius.SendSecure.Helpers.ContactMethod { Destination = "555-232-5334", DestinationType = XMedius.SendSecure.Helpers.ContactMethod.DestinationTypeT.CellPhone };
            recipient.GuestOptions.ContactMethods.Add(contactMethod);
            safebox.Participants.Add(recipient);

            XMedius.SendSecure.Client client = new Client(token, userId, "deathstar", new Uri("https://portal.xmedius.com"));
            XMedius.SendSecure.Helpers.Safebox safeboxResponse = await client.SubmitSafeboxAsync(safebox2);

            Console.WriteLine(safeboxResponse.PreviewUrl);
            return safeboxResponse.PreviewUrl;
        }
    }
}
```
